# README for NER-Based Speaker Replacement

## Overview
This script processes a transcript where speakers are labeled as `SpeakerX`. It:
1. Extracts named entities (e.g., person names) from the text.
2. Filters these entities to identify unique speaker names.
3. Replaces `SpeakerX` labels in the transcript with the corresponding names.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     INPUT_FILE=path/to/input/ner-transcript.txt
     OUTPUT_FILE=path/to/output/output_ner-transcript.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Ensure all required libraries (e.g., `spacy`, `python-dotenv`) are installed.
   - Execute the script: `python script_name.py`

3. **Output**:
   - The updated transcript will be written to the file specified in the `OUTPUT_FILE` variable.

## Features
- **Entity Extraction**: Uses SpaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model to identify person names.
- **Dynamic Speaker Mapping**: Matches `SpeakerX` labels to the sequence of extracted names.
- **Fallback Handling**: Labels unmatched speakers as `Unknown_SpeakerX`.

## Potential Limitations
### 1. **Dependence on Entity Extraction**:
   - The script relies on SpaCy's `PERSON` entity label. If a name is not correctly identified as a person (e.g., unusual formatting, misspellings, or non-standard names), it might be missed.

### 2. **Order Dependency**:
   - The script assumes that `SpeakerX` labels in the transcript correspond to the sequential order of names introduced in the text. This assumption may fail if:
     - Speakers introduce others before themselves.
     - The order of `SpeakerX` labels does not match the sequence of name mentions.

### 3. **Filtered Names**:
   - Single-word names (e.g., "David") are excluded unless explicitly required. This can result in missed speakers in some cases.

### 4. **Unseen Transcript Variability**:
   - Unstructured or complex transcripts may introduce challenges such as:
     - Nested dialogues or overlapping speech.
     - Non-standard `SpeakerX` labeling formats (e.g., `Speaker_1`).
     - Names combined with titles (e.g., "Dr. Alice Roberts").

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Enhanced Name Extraction**:
   - Use additional heuristics to identify speaker names (e.g., proximity to "I am," "My name is").

2. **Context-Based Label Matching**:
   - Incorporate context-based analysis to better map `SpeakerX` labels to speakers (e.g., analyzing preceding sentences).

3. **Generalization Testing**:
   - Test the script on various transcripts to refine its handling of edge cases.

4. **Custom Entity Recognition**:
   - Train a custom NER model tailored to specific transcript structures if required.
