Speaker1: Hello, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Alice Roberts, and I’m the head of regional sales.  I’ll be chairing this meeting today. The first thing I’d like to do is go round the room and have everyone introduce themselves.

Speaker2: Hi, I’m David Smith and I work in book sales alongside Sally here.

Speaker3: Thanks David. So as David said, I’m Sally, Sally Jones, I’ve been in book sales for 10 years now.

Speaker4: Nice to meet everyone, although I already know Alice. Anyway, Paul Owens, that’s me. I’m interested in buying some of your stuff, especially those new Richard Osman books. Hopefully we can do business together.

Speaker1: Thanks everyone, and yes just to bring David and Sally up to speed Paul and I had an initial meeting last week.

Speaker3: Ah, that explains why we’re here!

Speaker2: Yes.
